It's hard to describe how I got into software development; it's something to which I have always been drawn. 

My background is a little different from others in the tech field. As a young girl, I fell in love with chess, which cultivated my appreciation of strategy, planning ahead, analytical thinking, attention to detail, and my ability to find creative solutions. 

As a teenager, I grew from e-mail bombing my friends on AOL to building my second computer. I was introduced to Warcraft games, and began to wonder how I could make such a thing. I began to tell my friends that had interests in IT and programming that I was interested in learning how to program myself. Their response was not encouraging: “You would be the only woman in the office.” “17 is too late to start – I built my first computer when I was 10!”

But no matter how many times it was snuffed out, my spark rekindled. When I realized I could tinker with the code on my Myspace page to give my page a personal touch. Soon I had friends asking me to code their pages, too. I recall being enthralled, staying up until 4 AM revamping pages to my friends’ specifications. I had no idea how to take this passion to the next level though. As the years went by I dealt with other life challenges - taking care of family members, moving across the country twice - until I discovered the world of coding bootcamps, and quickly enrolled with the Flation School. 

I have no difficulty following up a full day of work with an evening spent coding, because this is what I love to do. My passion and journey to become a programmer has only grown over time. Software development has always been a part of my life. I decided to further my skills because I find it fun to create. I love the challenge, and I love the possiblity that I can be a part of creating something that can bring people together.
